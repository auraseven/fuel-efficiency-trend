# ✈️ Aircraft Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the **fuel consumption (L/passenger/100km)** of different aircraft based on features like weight, engine type, wingspan, and cruise speed.

### 🔍 Objective
Use regression techniques to help design more **fuel-efficient aircraft** — supporting sustainability in aviation.

### 📊 Dataset
Simulated aircraft specs from real-world models (A320, B737, B787, etc.).  
Includes: Max Takeoff Weight, Engine Type, Wingspan, Cruise Speed, Fuel Burn.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Random Forest Regressor
- Data preprocessing, encoding, and feature importance analysis

### 📈 Sample Output
